nanochat is the simplest experimental harness for training LLMs. It is designed to run on a single GPU node, the code is minimal/hackable, and it covers all major LLM stages including tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and a chat UI. For example, you can train your own GPT-2 capability LLM (which cost ~$50,000 to train in 2019) for only $73 (3 hours of 8XH100 GPU node) and then talk to it in a familiar ChatGPT-like web UI.

For questions about the repo, I recommend either using [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/karpathy/nanochat) from Devin/Cognition to ask questions about the repo, or use the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions), or come by the [#nanochat](https://discord.com/channels/1020383067459821711/1427295580895314031) channel on Discord.

## Updates

- (Jan 31 2026) Major revamp of all scripts/README ongoing, deleting midtraining stage, might be a bit messy briefly...
- (Jan 30 2026) With all the latest improvements we're able to train GPT-2 grade LLM in about $73. The [runs/speedrun.sh](runs/speedrun.sh) script will become the refernece way to train GPT-2 grade model and talk to it.

The primary metric we care about is "time to GPT-2" - the wall clock time needed to outperform the GPT-2 (1.6B) CORE metric on an 8XH100 GPU node. The GPT-2 CORE score is 0.256525. In 2019, the training of GPT-2 cost approximately $50,000 so it is incredible that due to many advances over 7 years across the stack, we can now do so much faster and for well below $100 (e.g. at the current ~$3/GPU/hr, an 8XH100 node is ~$24/hr, so 3 hours is ~$72).

See [dev/LEADERBOARD.md](dev/LEADERBOARD.md) for more docs on how to interpret and contribute to the leaderboard.

## Getting started

### Reproduce and talk to GPT-2

The most fun you can have is to train your own GPT-2 and talk to it. The entire pipeline to do so is contained in the single file [runs/speedrun.sh](runs/speedrun.sh), which is designed to be run on an 8XH100 GPU node. Currently, at ~$24/hour for these nodes, pretraining GPT-2 grade model takes approximately 3 hours and will set you back about $75. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like [Lambda](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud)), and kick off the training script:

```bash
bash runs/speedrun.sh
```

You mish to do so in a screen session as this will take ~3 hours to run. Once it's done, you can talk to it via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run `source .venv/bin/activate`), and serve it:

```bash
python -m scripts.chat_web
```

And then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you're on, followed by the port, so for example [http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/](http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/), etc. Then talk to your LLM as you'd normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it's green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it's a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).

A few more notes:

- The code will run just fine on the Ampere 8XA100 GPU node as well, but a bit slower.
- All code will run just fine on even a single GPU by omitting `torchrun`, and will produce ~identical results (code will automatically switch to gradient accumulation), but you'll have to wait 8 times longer.
- If your GPU(s) have less than 80GB, you'll have to tune some of the hyperparameters or you will OOM / run out of VRAM. Look for `--device_batch_size` in the scripts and reduce it until things fit. E.g. from 32 (default) to 16, 8, 4, 2, or even 1. Less than that you'll have to know a bit more what you're doing and get more creative.
- Most of the code is fairly vanilla PyTorch so it should run on anything that supports that - xpu, mps, or etc, but I haven't personally exercised all of these code paths so there might be sharp edges.

## Research

If you are a researcher and wish to help improve nanochat, two scripts of interest are [runs/scaling_laws.sh](runs/scaling_laws.sh) and [runs/miniseries.sh](runs/miniseries.sh). See [Jan 7 miniseries v1](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/420) for related documentation. For quick experimentation (~5 min pretraining runs) my favorite scale is to train a 12-layer model (GPT-1 sized), e.g. like this:

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_train -- \
    --depth=12 \
    --run="d12" \
    --model-tag="d12" \
    --core-metric-every=999999 \
    --sample-every=-1 \
    --save-every=-1 \
```

This uses wandb (run name "d12"), only runs the CORE metric on last step, and it doesn't sample and save intermediate checkpoints. I like to change something in the code, re-run a d12 (or a d16 etc) and see if it helped, in an iteration loop.

The overall approach is to treat the depth of the model as the single dial of complexity. By sweeping out the depth, we get increasingly more powerful models. We determine the scaling laws, set the data budget to a compute optimal setting, train a whole miniseries of models of increasing sizes, and compare them to the GPT-2 and GPT-3 miniseries. Right now, beating GPT-2 specifically faster and faster is the most interesting target.

## Running on CPU / MPS

The script [runs/runcpu.sh](runs/runcpu.sh) shows a very simple example of running on CPU or Apple Silicon. It dramatically shrinks the LLM tha tis being trained to make things fit into a reasonable time interval of a few ten minutes of training. You will not get strong results in this way.

## Guides

I've published a number of guides that might contain helpful information:

- [Oct 13 2025 original nanochat post](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1) introducing nanochat, though now it contains some deprecated information and the model is a lot older (with worse results) than current master.
- [Jan 7 miniseries v1](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/420) documents the first nanochat miniseries of models.
- To customize your nanochat, see [Guide: infusing identity to your nanochat](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/139) in Discussions, which describes how you can tune your nanochat's personality through synthetic data generation and mixing that data into the SFT stage.
- To add new abilities to nanochat, see [Guide: counting r in strawberry (and how to add abilities generally)](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/164).

## Contributing

The goal of nanochat is to improve the state of the art in micro models that are accessible to work with end to end on budgets of < $1000 dollars. Accessibility is about overall cost but also about cognitive complexity - nanochat is not an exhaustively configurable LLM "framework"; there are no giant configuration objects, model factories, or if-then-else monsters in the code base. It is a single, cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally-forkable "strong baseline" codebase designed to run start to end and produce a ChatGPT model you can talk to. Currently, the most interesting part personally is speeding up the latency to GPT-2 (i.e. getting a CORE score above 0.256525). Currently this takes ~3 hours, but by improving the pretraining stage we can improve this further.
