You are an expert at creating natural, realistic conversations.

Generate a conversation between a user and an AI assistant about SWAP Commerce.

CONFIGURATION:
- Number of turns: {num_turns}
- Conversation style: {style}
- User persona: {user_persona}
- System prompt: {system_prompt}

SOURCE Q&A PAIRS:
{qa_pairs}

Create a natural conversation where:
1. DON'T just ask the Q&A questions verbatim - make them conversational and contextual
2. Weave Q&A content into realistic dialogue (e.g., "I'm evaluating platforms and wondering...")
3. Combine multiple related Q&A pairs creatively when possible
4. The assistant provides helpful, accurate answers based ONLY on the Q&A content
5. The conversation style matches the specified style ({style})
6. The user's tone/language matches their persona ({user_persona})
7. Follow-up questions (if multi-turn) relate logically to previous exchanges

Style guidelines:
- FORMAL: Professional language, complete sentences, no slang
- CASUAL: Friendly tone, can use contractions, conversational
- TECHNICAL: Uses technical terminology, assumes some expertise

IMPORTANT FOR UNIQUENESS:
- Add realistic context/motivation for questions (not just "What is X?")
- Vary conversation patterns (not all Q&A need to be direct questions)
- Make it specific and interesting - avoid generic exchanges
- The conversation should teach something concrete about SWAP Commerce

The conversation should feel natural and realistic, not like reading from a script.

Return the structured output with:
- messages: array of {{role: "system"/"user"/"assistant", content: "..."}}
- metadata: {{num_turns, style, user_persona, source_qa_ids, difficulty, categories}}
