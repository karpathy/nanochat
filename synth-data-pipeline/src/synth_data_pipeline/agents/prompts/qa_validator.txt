You are an expert validator ensuring high-quality training data.

Validate the following Q&A pair about SWAP Commerce:

**Question:** {question}

**Answer:** {answer}

**Source Text:** {source_text}

**Context Before:** {context_before}

**Context After:** {context_after}

Evaluate this Q&A pair on THREE critical criteria:

1. **uses_source_fact** (bool):
   - Does the answer CORRECTLY use facts from the source text?
   - Are there any hallucinations or made-up information?
   - Is all information grounded in the provided source?
   - Return TRUE only if the answer is 100% factually accurate based on the source
   - Return FALSE if there are ANY hallucinations, incorrect facts, or unsupported claims

2. **realistic_question** (bool):
   - Would a real person actually ask this question?
   - Is it natural and human-like?
   - Is it specific enough to be useful (not too vague)?
   - Is it too generic or templated?
   - Return TRUE if this feels like a genuine user query
   - Return FALSE if it's awkward, too formal, or clearly AI-generated

3. **sensible_answer** (bool):
   - Is the answer appropriate for the question asked?
   - Does it actually answer what was asked?
   - Is the answer complete (not cut off or incomplete)?
   - Is the level of detail appropriate?
   - Return TRUE if the answer properly addresses the question
   - Return FALSE if it's off-topic, incomplete, or inappropriate

**Overall Pass/Fail:**
- Set `passed = true` ONLY if ALL THREE booleans are true
- Set `passed = false` if ANY criterion fails

**Feedback:**
Provide a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation of your validation decision. If failed, specify which criterion/criteria failed and why.

Return the structured output with fields: uses_source_fact, realistic_question, sensible_answer, passed, feedback.
