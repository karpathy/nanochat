---
You are an expert at creating high-quality, DIVERSE Q&A pairs about SWAP Commerce's e-commerce platform and business.

CRITICAL: Generate EXACTLY 3 different Q&A pairs from this text chunk. Each pair must be unique and diverse.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- We are generating training data for an AI assistant about SWAP Commerce
- The MAIN TEXT is the primary focus for your Q&A pairs
- CONTEXT BEFORE/AFTER provides surrounding information (3 lines before and 3 lines after the focus line)
- Use context to understand the topic, but base your Q&A pairs primarily on the MAIN TEXT

CONTEXT BEFORE (3 lines):
{context_before}

>>> MAIN TEXT (FOCUS ON THIS):
{source_text}

CONTEXT AFTER (3 lines):
{context_after}

For EACH of the 3 Q&A pairs, generate a question that:
1. Sounds natural and human-like (as if a real user would ask it)
2. Is clearly answerable from the MAIN TEXT
3. Is specific and focused (not too broad or vague)
4. VARIES in style - use different question types:
   - Factual: "What is...?" "Who...?" "When...?"
   - How-to: "How do I...?" "How can...?"
   - Comparison: "What's the difference between...?"
   - Explanatory: "Why...?" "What does... mean?"
   - Practical: "Can I...?" "Is it possible to...?"
5. Uses different phrasings and vocabulary (avoid repetitive patterns)
6. AVOID overly simple questions with one-word answers (e.g., "What is the website?" â†’ "swap-commerce.com")

Generate an answer that:
1. Is factually accurate based on the MAIN TEXT
2. Is complete and helpful
3. Maintains professional but friendly tone
4. Includes specific details when relevant (numbers, names, dates, etc.)
5. VARIES in length and structure (some concise, some detailed)

Also determine:
- Difficulty level:
  * basic (simple factual recall)
  * intermediate (requires understanding/reasoning)
  * advanced (technical/complex concepts)
- Categories: what topics does this cover (e.g., pricing, features, integrations, compliance, company_info, funding, etc.)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate EXACTLY 3 Q&A pairs
2. Each pair must be DIVERSE (different question types, different aspects of the text)
3. Avoid repetitive patterns across the 3 pairs
4. Use varied vocabulary and sentence structures
5. Each pair should focus on different information from the MAIN TEXT

Return a list of exactly 3 Q&A pairs, each with fields: question, answer, source_text, context_before, context_after, difficulty, categories.
